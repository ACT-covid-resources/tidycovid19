# Download, Tidy and Visualize Covid-19 Related Data

## Disclaimer

I am an applied economist studying the economic effects of regulatory interventions on corporate transparency and leading the Open Science Data Center (OSDC) of the [TRR 266 Accounting for Transparency](https://accounting-for-transparency.de), which is funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG).
The OSDC has the objective to make research transparent in a way that others can contribute and collaborate.

This is the spirit that motivated me to set up this package. I am clearly no epidemiologist so I will abstain from from providing infrastructure for analyzing the spread of the disease or estimating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Instead this package serves the purpose to  facilitate the use of various Covid-19 related data sources with a special focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions.

In that way, I hope that it might be helpful for others that are interested in doing research on the Covid 19 pandemic by promoting the benefits of open science.


## Why yet another package on Covid-19?

There are several packages that provide data and infrastructure related to Covid-19. Two prominent cases are:

- `{nCov2019}`: This [package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019) has a focus on Chinese data but also contains data on other countries and regions. It contains a shiny dashboard. 
- `{conronavirus}`: This [package](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) provides
the Johns Hopkins University CSSE dataset together with a dashboard

Additional R related resources on Covid-19 can be found [here](https://www.statsandr.com/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/) and [here](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r).

Other than the packages mentioned above, the key objective of the {tidycovid19} package is to provide *transparent* access to *various* data sources, including data on governmental interventions. It does not contain any data per se. Instead, it provides functions to pull data from publicly available sources.

For those interested in speedy downloads it alternatively provides the option to download from the cached data in this repo (stored in the directory `cached_data`). The cached data is updated daily.

If you rather want to start your own project by customizing the code of this package to fit your needs, I suggest that you take a look at my [Github repository "tidy_covid19"](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidy_covid19) (mind the underscore).
This repo presents a forkable code infrastructure for Covid 19 projects using the same data infrastructure.

## The Data

Currently, the package offers the following functions to download data:

- `download_jhu_csse_covid19_data()`: Downloads and tidies [Covid-19 data from the Johns Hopkins University CSSE Github Repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This data has developed to a standard resource for researchers and the general audience 
interested in assessing the global spreading of the virus. The data is aggregated to the country level.
- `download_acaps_npi_data()`: Downloads and tidies the [Government measures dataset provided by the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS)](https://www.acaps.org/covid19-government-measures-dataset). These relatively new data allow researchers to study the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the development of the virus. 
- `download_oxford_npi_data()`: Downloads and tidies data from the [Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker), an alternative data source for governmental interventions. Currently, I do not include the financial measures of this data set and also do not include its data in the merged data file (see below) as I view the ACAPS data to be better suited ([this blog post details why](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/2020/04/exploring-and-benchmarking-oxford-government-response-data/)). 
- **NEW**: `download_google_cmr_pdfs()`/`scrape_google_cmr_data()`: Downloads and scrapes [Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). These reports come in PDF format and contain information on the changes in geographical moving patterns across georgraphic regions. As daily data is only provided as line graphs in these documents, I scan these graphs to provide country-day data. This process generates noisy measures and is likely to break as soon Google is changing the PDF format of the reports. The function `download_google_cmr_pdfs()` downloads the PDF reports directly to a local directory.
- `download_google_trends_data()`: Downloads and tidies [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) data on the search volume for the term "coronavirus" (Thank you to Yan Ouaknine for bringing up that idea!). This data can be used to assess the public attention to Covid-19 across countries and over time within a given country.
- `download_wbank_data()`: Downloads and tidies additional country level information provided by the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org) using the {wbstats} package. These data allow researchers to calculate per capita measures of the virus spread and to assess the association of macro-economic variables with the development of the virus.
- `download_merged_data()`: Downloads all data sources and creates a merged country-day panel sample.


## Visualization

The focus of the package lies on data collection and not on visualization as there are already many great tools floating around. The function `plot_covid19_spread()` however, allows you to quickly visualize the spread of the virus in relation to governmental intervention measures. It is inpired by the insightful displays created by John Burn-Murdoch from the Financial Times and offers various customization options.

```{r DemoPlot}
#remotes::install_github("joachim-gassen/tidycovid19")

library(tidycovid19)

merged <- download_merged_data(cached = TRUE)
plot_covid19_spread(
  merged, highlight = c("ITA", "ESP", "FRA", "DEU", "USA"),
  intervention = "lockdown", edate_cutoff = 40
)
```


## Shiny App

Sorry, I could not resist. The options of the `plot_covid19_spread()` make the 
implementation of a shiny app a little bit to tempting to pass. The command
`shiny_covid19_spread()` starts the app. Click on the image to be taken to the 
online app. You can use it to customize your `plot_covid19_spread()`
display as it allows copying the plot generating code to the clipboard,
thanks to the fine [{rclipboard}](https://github.com/sbihorel/rclipboard) 
package. You can now also customize the app by providing `plot_covid19_spread()`
options as a list to the `plot_options` parameter.

As the shinyapps.io server has had some issues with exhausting connections, you can also
use this [alternative server](https://trr266.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/shiny/tidycovid19/).
