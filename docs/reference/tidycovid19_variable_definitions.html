It puts together measures implemented by governments worldwide in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Data collection includes secondary data review. The data is reported in event structure with an event reflecting a government measure. Measures are characterized as being either imposing/extending measures or lifting them and categorized in five categories with each category being split up in further sub-categories.

#&gt; 29 Data are Google Search Volume (GSV) measures as provided by Google Trends API, with the default search term 'coronavirus'. The data comes in four data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter and the sample period comprises Jan 1, 2020 up to date. The 'country' data frame lists GSV by country, to assess which country on average uses the search term most often over the sample period. The 'country-day' data frame reports daily search volume data for all countries that show up in the 'country' data frame. Each value is relative within country, meaning that values across countries cannot be compared directly. The 'region' and 'city' data frames list the relative GSV across regions and city within countries when provided by Google Trends. Keep in mind that within each data frame GSV are relative measures with a maximum of 100 indicating the highest search volume. This implies that GSV measures are not comparable across data frames.

When you set the parameter 'var_def' tot 'TRUE'. the data comes in a list containing two data frames. The first contains the actual data, the second contains variable definitions.
