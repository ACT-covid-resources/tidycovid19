The data frame is organized by country-day and its data are expressed as percentages relative to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. The data comes in three data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter. The 'country' data frame contains country-day level data. The 'country_region' data frame provides regional data for regions for which Apple reports regional data. The 'country_city' data frame reports city-level data for cities for which Apple reports this data. Please Note: The original data does not link regions and cities back to countries. This link has been introduced based on geocoding and manual inspection of the results. You can find the according code in the github repository of the {tidycovid19} package but user discretion is advised when using the sub-country level data.

They show how visits and length of stays at different places change in percentages compared to a baseline (the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020). The data comes in three data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter. The 'country' data frame contains country-day level data.

#&gt; 21 Data are Google Search Volume (GSV) measures as provided by Google Trends API, with the default search term 'coronavirus'. The data comes in four data frames that you can select by the 'type' parameter and the sample period comprises Jan 1, 2020 up to date. The 'country' data frame lists GSV by country, to assess which country on average uses the search term most often over the sample period. The 'country-day' data frame reports daily search volume data for all countries that show up in the 'country' data frame. Each value is relative within country, meaning that values across countries cannot be compared directly. The 'region' and 'city' data frames list the relative GSV across regions and city within countries when provided by Google Trends. Keep in mind that within each data frame GSV are relative measures with a maximum of 100 indicating the highest search volume. This implies that GSV measures are not comparable across data frames.
